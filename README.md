  * Search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
